Raspberry Pi video and GPIO control
-----------------------------------

This set of scripts for the Raspberry Pi, used in my [Proposal Box](https://vimeo.com/120209590) project.  The scripts are used for the following tasks:

1. Automate launching the scripts on startup
2. Controlling OMXPlayer from Python (this is done using [Bounder's fork of pyomxplayer](https://github.com/Bounder/pyomxplayer))
3. Using Pi GPIO to read input from the magnetic reed switch in the box lid
4. Using the Pi GPIO to control the LEDs that illuminate teh ring at the end
